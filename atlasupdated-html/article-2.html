                All Quiet on the Western Front has been adapted for the third
                time when Netflix dropped their version of the novel. This time,
                it is adapted in German giving the film more authenticity. All
                Quiet on the Western Front (Im Westen nichts Neues) is a novel
                based on the real-life experience of author Erich Maria Remarque
                during the first World War as a German soldier. It tells the
                story of Paul Baumer, student who enlists in the German army at
                the height of extreme nationalism, his enthusiasm quickly wanes
                as he learns the realities of war.

                There is much to unpack in this story, the novel itself was
                considered controversial during its initial release. At the time
                of its release, WWI was still fresh in people’s minds, there has
                been widespread nationalism, people and politicians alike have
                romanticized the exploits of war leaving an impression of
                grandeur in the battlefield. The release of Remarque’s novel
                shattered the illusion of grandeur and honor. People who have
                never been to war have only begun to realize that it is not all
                guts and glory on the battlefield and... They did that like
                that. Remarque’s novel was met with much criticism, Leaders did
                not like that this could wane the increasing patriotism of young
                boys who could become great assets in their military and
                political exploits and the masses did not like that the
                realities of war was far from what they have been fed with.

                The 2022 film pulled no punches in depicting the realities of
                war. The beginning of the film shows an entirely different
                person in the frontlines, Heinrich, as he tries to traverse
                through the battlefield unscathed only to cut to another scene
                of dead bodies and old uniforms being repaired with Heinrich’s
                tag confirming the man’s death. We would then see Paul Baumer
                and his friends enthusiastic about joining the war, this scene,
                I believe, was not as nuanced as the other films as they went
                out their way to portray the overarching nationalism that
                convinced the boys to enlist. The scene would then transition to
                a part where they were given their uniforms, we would later find
                out that Paul was given Heinrich’s uniform which made it even
                more impactful to its message later. The boys would then be
                assigned to the West Front and be thrusted into battle in their
                first day in the military. From then, we would see how the
                enthusiasm and the life of Paul wane as he loses more and gains
                nothing in this war. This film is a highly effective war film in
                the sense that the heroes gained nothing from any of this. Stark
                contrast from other war films where the hero’s journey would end
                in a bittersweet ending or a legacy that will be left. In this
                film, it is simply bleak. There was nothing Paul and anyone
                gained there, everything they fought for and everything they
                stood for is... Pointless. This is seen in the recycled uniforms
                in the beginning of the film and in the end when Paul finally
                met his demise. These soldiers were simply collateral in the
                battle between two political machineries. This would even be
                more solidified in the fact that Paul and Kat could have
                survived the war had the agreement took place immediately
                instead of six hours after, because on those six hours, 2,000
                more men died including Paul. The war ends with nothing gained,
                thousands of lives lost, Germany lost, and Paul lost his life in
                a pointless war... his name forgotten; he would only be known as
                another German soldier... Another collateral.

              In 1930, All Quiet on the Western Front would make its Hollywood
              debut, it opened to much acclaim and controversy. The film was
              picked up, adapted, and played by actual WWI veterans which made
              it a very authentic experience for the audience in 1930s. During
              that period, this was considered harrowing and eye-opening as the
              audience had never had an adaptation of war so bleak and realistic
              before. The background extras were real-life German soldiers, the
              training scenes and how the props were made to look like were
              supplemented by these veterans making the film as accurate as
              possible. One certain scene where a soldier grabbed on to the
              barbed wire only to explode only to have his hands on the barbed
              wire left was a real story from one of the German soldiers in the
              set. During the release of this film, it was banned in some
              countries, most notably in its native Germany for its perceived
              anti-German sentiments, Adolf Hitler, himself, had opposed the
              film’s release. In 1979, a Golden-Globe and Emmy nominated
              television series was made based on Remarque’s novel. In 2022,
              Netflix released a movie about Remarque’s novel spoken in its
              native German which also received positive reception.
